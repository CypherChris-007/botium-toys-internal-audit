## 🛡️ Botium Toys Internal Security Audit (Beginner Summary)

🔍 Overview
---
This project was part of an online learning module where I practiced completing a basic internal security audit for a fictional company. The activity helped me understand how organizations protect their data and follow security rules.


## 🧩 Fundamental Cybersecurity Skills I Learned


-------------------------
  1. Identifying Assets 
--------------------------
I learned how to find and list important items the company uses, such as:

- Computers

- Network systems

- Software

- Databases

- Physical security equipment

This helped me understand what needs to be protected.

--------------------------
2. Checking Security Controls
--------------------------
- I reviewed whether important protections were in place, including:

- Password policies

- Firewalls

- Antivirus

- Encryption

- Backups

- Physical security (locks, cameras, fire systems)

- This showed me which basic security measures the company was missing.
--------------------------
3. Understanding Compliance
--------------------------
I learned the purpose of beginner-level compliance standards like:

- PCI DSS — protects credit card information

- GDPR — protects the data of E.U. customers

I checked whether the company followed these rules.

--------------------------
4. Basic Risk Awareness
--------------------------
I practiced:

- Identifying missing protections

- Understanding how missing controls create risk

- Reviewing a simple risk score

- This helped me see how small issues can lead to bigger security problems.
  
--------------------------
5. Making Simple Recommendations
--------------------------
- I suggested easy improvements such as:

- Stronger passwords

- Adding encryption

- Creating backups

- Improving access control

- These are basic steps that help keep systems safe.
